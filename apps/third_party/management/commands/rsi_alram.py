        * RSI Calculation Formula
            RSI = 100 â€“ 100 / ( 1 + RS )
            RS = Relative Strength = AvgU / AvgD
            AvgU = average of all up moves in the last N price bars
            AvgD = average of all down moves in the last N price bars
            N = the period of RSI
            There are 3 different commonly used methods for the exact calculation of AvgU and AvgD (see details below)

        * RSI Calculation Step by Step
            Calculate up moves and down moves (get U and D)
            Average the up moves and down moves (get AvgU and AvgD)
            Calculate Relative Strength (get RS)
            Calculate the Relative Strength Index (get RSI)
